**Details:**   
Assume you are a project manager in an agile environment working with scrum practices. While checking project progress, you find out that your team is not delivering results as expected and is busy working with many tasks. You decide to implement a new approach, what new approach would you use? And why?   
**Answer:**  
I would use Kanban method, because it focuses on limiting the work in progress (WIP) so the team is concerned with finishing existing work. The Kanban method is about focusing on completing work than starting new piece of work.
